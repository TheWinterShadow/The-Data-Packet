Alex: Hey everyone, welcome to Tech Daily! I'm Alex.
Sam: And I'm Sam. It's Wednesday, December 11th, and we've got a really interesting mix for you today.
Alex: We do. So we're starting with something pretty serious—there was a major hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday about government surveillance. Specifically, how the FBI can search Americans' communications without a warrant under this law called Section 702. It's actually gotten rare bipartisan attention.
Sam: Yeah, privacy advocates and former prosecutors both showing up to say the same thing—that's unusual.
Alex: It really is. And then we're switching gears completely to talk about quantum computing. Google, IBM, Microsoft—they're all pouring billions into this technology, and WIRED just put out this massive explainer that actually makes sense of where we are right now.
Sam: The "awkward teenage phase," as they're calling it.
Alex: Exactly. It's not ready yet, but it's getting there. So two very different stories today—surveillance and quantum tech.
Sam: Let's do it.
Alex: Alright, let's start with what happened on Capitol Hill yesterday...

Alex: Alright, so there was a pretty intense hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday about government surveillance—
Sam: Yeah, and this one's getting bipartisan attention, which is rare these days.
Alex: Right, so what's going on? This is about Section 702, right?
Sam: Exactly. Section 702 of FISA—the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It's basically a law that lets the government collect communications from foreigners overseas for intelligence purposes. But here's the thing—when those foreigners are talking to Americans, those American communications get swept up too.
Alex: Okay, and then what happens to all that data?
Sam: It goes into massive government databases. NSA collects it, shares it with the FBI, CIA, and the National Counterterrorism Center. And here's where it gets controversial—the FBI can search those databases using Americans' names, phone numbers, email addresses, all without getting a warrant first.
Alex: Wait, so they're searching Americans' communications without a warrant?
Sam: That's the concern. Privacy advocates call it a "backdoor search." The law says you can't intentionally target Americans, but once their data is in the system, agents can query it whenever they want.
Alex: How often is this happening?
Sam: The FBI alone did 57,000 of these searches in 2023. Now, officials say that number dropped after some reforms last year, but witnesses at this hearing said the FBI basically changed what it counts as a query, so we don't actually know the real number anymore.
Alex: Yikes. So who's pushing back on this?
Sam: That's what's interesting—it's everyone. You've got conservative Republicans who hate "deep state" surveillance, progressive Democrats who don't trust the Trump administration with this power, former prosecutors, civil liberties groups. One witness, Brett Tolman, was a former US attorney who was literally in the room when Section 702 was being sold to Congress back in the day.
Alex: And what'd he say?
Sam: He said they were promised it wouldn't be abused against Americans, and he called that "a lie." Pretty strong words from a former federal prosecutor.
Alex: Wow. So what are they asking Congress to do?
Sam: They want a warrant requirement. Before the FBI can search these databases for Americans' communications, they'd have to go to a judge and show probable cause—just like they would for any other search. Right now, they just need approval from their own supervisors.
Alex: Which is very different from getting a judge to sign off.
Sam: Completely different standard. And there's this other issue that came up—last year's reauthorization actually expanded who can be forced to help with surveillance. The definition of "electronic communication service provider" got way broader.
Alex: What does that mean in practice?
Sam: Think about it this way—it used to be companies like Verizon or Google. Now the language is so broad that witnesses said it could include landlords of office buildings, anyone with access to communications equipment. And unlike tech companies, a landlord can't just isolate one person's messages, so they might have to give the NSA direct access to all the communications flowing through a building.
Alex: That seems... really expansive.
Sam: Yeah, even the tech industry trade groups are pushing back on that one. And then there's the data broker loophole—agencies are just buying Americans' location data and browsing history from commercial data brokers instead of getting warrants.
Alex: Can they do that?
Sam: That's the debate. The Supreme Court has said if the government demands your cell phone location data directly, that's a Fourth Amendment search and needs a warrant. But agencies claim if they buy the same data from a broker, no warrant needed.
Alex: So they're just purchasing their way around the Fourth Amendment?
Sam: That's what the critics say. The FBI, DEA, Secret Service, even the IRS have all bought this kind of data.
Alex: Okay, so what happens next? This law expires next year, right?
Sam: April 2026. So we're looking at a big reauthorization fight over the next year. Both sides are dug in—intelligence officials say these reforms are working and the tool is vital. Critics say the reforms don't go far enough and without a warrant requirement, this is just domestic spying with extra steps.
Alex: And with the current administration installing loyalists at the FBI and Justice Department, the stakes feel higher.
Sam: Exactly. Even Jim Jordan, who chairs the committee, said the answer is simple—just require probable-cause warrants like we do for everything else. So this is definitely one to watch as we get closer to that April deadline.
Alex: Yeah, because this affects basically everyone who communicates with anyone overseas, which is a lot of people.

Sam: Yeah, because this affects basically everyone who communicates with anyone overseas, which is a lot of people.
Alex: It really is. Alright, completely switching gears now—let's talk about quantum computing.
Sam: Very different topic.
Alex: Very different. But fascinating.

Alex: Alright, so quantum computing—it's one of those things we hear about constantly, but WIRED just published this massive explainer, and I gotta say, I think I finally get what's actually happening here.
Sam: Yeah, this is a good moment to dig into it because we're kind of at this weird turning point. Like, it's not science fiction anymore, but it's also not... useful yet?
Alex: Right, that's what struck me. Google, IBM, Microsoft—they're pouring billions into this. Venture capitalists dropped nearly two billion dollars into quantum startups in 2022 alone. That's five times what they invested just three years earlier.
Sam: And here's the thing—they're not building these for your pocket. You're not getting a quantum iPhone. Think of it more like a specialized chip inside a supercomputer that you'd access through the cloud. For very specific problems, you'd tap into that quantum accelerator.
Alex: Okay, but what does it actually do? Like, walk me through the basic idea.
Sam: So regular computers use bits—zeros and ones, right? Quantum computers use qubits, and qubits can do something wild called superposition. Instead of being just zero or one, they exist as some probability of both at the same time. It's like a quarter flipping through the air—it's not heads or tails until it lands.
Alex: That's... kind of mind-bending.
Sam: Yeah, and there's this other effect called entanglement where qubits can be linked so that operations on one instantly affect another. Einstein literally called it "spooky action at a distance" because it bothered him so much.
Alex: I mean, if it bothered Einstein, I feel better about being confused. But what's the actual advantage here?
Sam: Speed, but only for certain types of problems. There's this famous example—Grover's algorithm could find your name in a phone book of 100 million people in just 10,000 operations. A regular computer would need 50 million operations on average.
Alex: Wow. So why aren't we using these things everywhere already?
Sam: Because qubits are incredibly finicky. They have to be kept at temperatures just fractions of a degree above absolute zero. Any stray heat or noise can cause errors. Right now, state-of-the-art quantum computers make an error about once every thousand operations. To do anything really useful, they need to get that down to like one error in a billion operations.
Alex: Yikes. That's a pretty big gap.
Sam: Right. So we're in what researchers call the NISQ era—Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers. It's pronounced "nisk," which sounds like we're in the awkward teenage phase of quantum computing.
Alex: I love that. So what can these awkward teenage quantum computers actually do right now?
Sam: Well, Google demonstrated in 2019 that their quantum computer could solve a specific math puzzle faster than a supercomputer. But—and this is important—the puzzle was commercially useless. It's like proving your car can go 200 miles per hour, but only on a track you specifically designed for that car.
Alex: So it's more about proving the concept than doing anything practical yet.
Sam: Exactly. But there are some promising areas on the horizon. Chemistry simulations are probably the first real application we'll see. Companies like Daimler and Volkswagen are already exploring this for designing better batteries for electric vehicles. The idea is that quantum computers can simulate how atoms and electrons behave during chemical reactions, which regular computers just can't do accurately.
Alex: What about the encryption thing? I've heard quantum computers could break all our current security.
Sam: Yeah, that's real. They could theoretically crack the encryption that protects online banking, shopping, all of that. But the quantum computers would need to be way more advanced than what we have now. Still, the US government is already working on new encryption systems to quantum-proof the internet before that becomes a problem.
Alex: Smart. So when are we actually going to see this stuff in the real world?
Sam: That's the question nobody working in quantum computing wants to answer, because honestly, nobody knows. It's still many years away. But what's changed is that it's started to feel less hypothetical. Companies are training programmers now, universities are offering quantum engineering degrees, and IBM even lets anyone experiment with their quantum processors online.
Alex: So basically, we're in the "get ready" phase, even though we don't know exactly when it's coming.
Sam: Pretty much. And if history is any guide, once it does arrive, the applications will probably go way beyond what we're predicting now. I mean, nobody in the early days of regular computing was thinking about kitten videos, but here we are.
Alex: Fair point. Definitely one to watch over the next few years.

Alex: Alright, so today we covered that Section 702 surveillance debate happening in Congress, and then dove into where quantum computing actually stands right now.
Sam: Government surveillance and quantum tech—quite the range.
Alex: That's Tech Daily for you. We'll be back tomorrow with more. Thanks for listening!
Sam: See you then.
